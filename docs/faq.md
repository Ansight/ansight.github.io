## What is the .ansight folder?
The `.ansight` folder is Ansights working directory for your solution.

This directory contains several SQLite database that are generated when Ansight indexes your projects. These databases are essential for many of Ansights features and are constantly regenerated.

It is safe to delete whenever you want however some features won't work correctly without it.

## Should I check .ansight into source control?

No, you should not check the `.ansight` folder into source control.

If you are using git, append the following text to the end of your `.gitignore` to exclude `.ansight`:

```
*.ansight/
```

The VisualStudio .gitignore that is available on www.github.com ignores the .ansight folder by default.
