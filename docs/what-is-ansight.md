!!! quote "Powerful insights for app sessions"

Use Ansight to record, replay and analyse sessions for an Android device.

 * ðŸ‘€  Observe the runtime behaviour of your Android device. View, filter and analyse device logs alongside a mirrored screen.
 * ðŸŽ¥  Record the screen and logs while using your device.
 * ðŸ“¼  Replay a device session, viewing its log data sequenced against the devices screen.

With Ansight, testers can create high-fidelity app-sesion recordings to easily communicate their findings to software engineers. A software engineer can use Ansight recordings to replay exactly what a tester did.

## High Fidelity Recording

Ansight records your devices logs and screen at the same time, enabling a side-by-side replay of what was happening on the screen with what was happening in the background.

In addition to the logs and screen, Ansight captures all device information like the system version, device make and model, its CPU architecture and more.

## Point Of Difference

Ansight is different from conventional testing and analytics tools as it:

 * Requires zero configuration, code changes or SDK installations.
 * Does not require any app's to be installed onto a users device.
 * Is compatible with all Android development frameworks and tools.

Once developer mode is enabled on a device, users can simply plug their device into their computer and start recording.

### Zero Configuration

Ansight does not require any code changes or SDK's to be added to your app.

By watching the system logs and your apps existing logging through `logcat`, Ansight can record your apps runtime behaviour for replaying and analysis.

### App Free

Ansight does not require any app to be installed onto a users device to be perform data-capturing.

A software tester or end user can plug their device into

All data capturing is performed on the machine running Ansight using the Android development toolchain.

### Toolchain Agnostic

Ansight is compatible with all Android development frameworks and tools.

By leveraging the Android development toolchain, Ansight can record and monitor any app that is built on any framework.

Any of the following frameworks can use Ansight to record testing sessions:

 * Android using Java.
 * Android using Kotlin.
 * Flutter.
 * React Native.
 * Xamarin/MAUI/.NET (both Xamarin.Android and Xamarin.Forms).

Additionally, Ansight could be used alongside any of the following IDEs record testing sessions:

 * Android Studio.
 * Visual Studio.
 * JetBrains Rider.
 * .
