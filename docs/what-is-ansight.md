Ansight is an advanced tool to aid you on identifying and solving bugs in Android (and in the future iOS) apps that can be used by testers or remote users to record sessions that can them be replayed on a controlled environment. 

With Ansight, testers and end-users can record sessions to demonstrate issues or bugs it may be finding on the apps. The recorded file can be handled to a developer to careful inspection. A recording is provided with full footage of the usage of the app and a timeline with detailed information about what happened during the session.
